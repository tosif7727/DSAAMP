# Data Preprocessing 🇵🇰

Data preprocessing is the **pehli step** in data analysis, where raw data is cleaned and prepared for further processing. It ensures that the data is **saaf suthra** and ready for machine learning models. 🧹✨

### Steps in Data Preprocessing:
1. **Data Cleaning** 🧼: Remove missing or duplicate values.  
    Example: If a dataset has `NaN` values, replace them with the average or median.  
2. **Data Transformation** 🔄: Convert data into a suitable format.  
    Example: Normalize numerical data between 0 and 1.  
3. **Data Reduction** 📉: Reduce the size of the dataset without losing important information.  
    Example: Use PCA to reduce dimensions.  
4. **Data Integration** 🤝: Combine data from multiple sources.  
    Example: Merge sales data from Lahore and Karachi.

### Example:
Imagine you have a dataset of cricket players 🏏 with missing ages. Fill the missing ages with the average age of the players. Then, normalize their scores to bring them on the same scale. **Ab data tayar hai!** 🎉

Data preprocessing is like making chai ☕—you need to prepare all the ingredients properly for the perfect taste! 😄
